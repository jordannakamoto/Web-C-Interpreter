# Simple C-Like Language Interpreter

C++ Interpreter in /Program directory  \\
NextJS Frontend in /src

This project is an interpreter for a simplified C-like language, designed to explore the fundamentals of language parsing, interpretation, and execution in a controlled environment.

## Features

- **Interactive Development Environment (IDE)**: A web-based interface that allows users to write, test, and run C-like language scripts.

## Usage

- Write your C-like code in the provided code editor.
- Use the IDE controls to step through the parsing process and execute your code.
- View parsing steps like "Remove Comments", "Tokenize", "CST", "Symbol Table", and "AST" in the dedicated panels.
