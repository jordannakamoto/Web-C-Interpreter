# Simple C-Like Language Interpreter

This project is an interpreter for a simplified C-like language, designed to explore the fundamentals of language parsing, interpretation, and execution in a controlled environment. The interpreter is built with C++ and a file interface to NodeJS connects us to the React/NextJS front end.

## Features

- **Interactive Development Environment (IDE)**: A web-based interface that allows users to write, test, and run C-like language scripts.

## Usage

- Write your C-like code in the provided code editor.
- Use the IDE controls to step through the parsing process and execute your code.
- View parsing steps like "Remove Comments", "Tokenize", "CST", "Symbol Table", and "AST" in the dedicated panels.
